        The domain of video games has long been dominated by 4 major company
        camps: Sony’s Playstation, Microsoft’s XBox, Nintendo and Valve’s Steam
        (PC). Our visualization project explores a dataset of around 16000 Video
        Games (with a focus on around 8000) across almost 4 decades and
        illustrates the development of this “Console War”. Our application
        consists of 4 distinct views and visualization begins with a
        scrollytelling view that provides an overview and statistical summary of
        the major companies. The application then proceeds to the Main page that
        focuses on sales numbers and allows users to select and filter games
        based on other attributes like years, genres and rating scores. Users of
        this application explore the dataset casually to enjoy and perhaps look
        up how their favourite franchise performs compared to other games. Users
        can also discover patterns and compare trends of how genres interact
        with different console companies, and how they influence the sales
        numbers. We believe this visualization can help users, both casual and
        experts, to visualize patterns in sales of Video Games.<br />
